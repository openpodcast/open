# Spotify Data

This uses our Spotify connector to fetch data for our podcasts from the Spotify
API. To add a new podcast, create a new workflow file in the `.github/workflows`
directory and set the required environment variables.

The connector is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/openpodcast/spotify-connector).
