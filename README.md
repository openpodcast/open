# ðŸ“ˆ Open Podcast Metrics

We want to make podcast metrics more accessible to the public. We believe that
podcast metrics should be open and available to everyone.

This is a set of connectors and scripts to collect podcast metrics.
We use the Podcast Hosting API's to get the latest metrics 
and send them to our [Open Podcast API] instance.


## Connectors

So far, we collect data from the following sources:

- Spotify
- Apple

Please see the subdirectories for more information.

## Contributing

If you also want to collect metrics for your podcast, please reach out
or directly create an issue. We'll get you onboarded.

You can also help contribute or request new connectors.
