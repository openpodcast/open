# Open Podcast Metrics

This is a set of connectors and scripts to collect and analyze podcast metrics.
It is a work in progress, and is not yet ready for general use.

We want to make podcast metrics more accessible to the public. We believe that
podcast metrics should be open and available to everyone.

We use the Podcast Hosting API's to get the latest podcast metrics. We then store them in
a database and make them available via a REST API.

## Connectors

So far, it can collect data from the following sources:

* Spotify

Please see the subdirectories for more information.
You can help contribute new connectors.
